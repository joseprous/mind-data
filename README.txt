The MIND Project: Mind Is Not Doomed
====================================

What is this project about?

- The MIND Project aims to develop a standalone technology demo for the recently released IdTech4 engine developed by IdSoftware.

Does that mean this is a game?

- No, But the idea is to provide a minimalist fully-functional set of contents so others can use this as a starting point for their own games.

What is this content you talk about?

- Well, so far we are in a exploratory fase, but content ranges from maps textures to user interface scripts (and pretty much everything you see and interact with, once you launched the game), so there is potentially a lot content to be replaced and provided.

Why just not using the DOOM3 or DOOM3 demo content?

- Even when most of the game and engine source code were released under GPL, all the game content remain propietary. Therefore, we need to provide some basic content in order to use the engine in a fully GPL way.

Do I have to pay for it?

- No. This is free as in free-dog-shit. We want you to get it even if you don't know you did ;).

I want to contribute, but I dont know how.

- Since the content is pretty much anything, there are many ways to contribute, from 2D graphic user interface icons (cursor, fonts and dialog decorations) to maps, models, sounds or whatever else you want. Don't be afraid, just do it.

What about the IdTech4 source code?

- We hope to contribute and stay close to the iodoom3 project.

How can I contact you guys?

- Just send a private message to joseprous or tchx84.

That's all for now.

Kind regards,
MIND Project Team.
